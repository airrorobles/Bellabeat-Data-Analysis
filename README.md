📊 Bellabeat Case Study: Smart Device Usage Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Fitbit smart device data to uncover trends in user activity, sleep, weight, and heart rate. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can inform Bellabeat’s product strategy and marketing approach.
The analysis follows the Google Data Analytics case study framework:
- Ask – Define the business problem
- Prepare – Import and clean the dataset
- Process – Transform and structure the data
- Analyze – Explore patterns and relationships
- Share – Visualize findings
- Act – Provide recommendations

📂 Dataset
- Source: Public Fitbit dataset (30 users, ~2 months of data)
- Key tables: Daily activity, sleep, weight logs, heart rate, hourly steps
- Limitations: Small sample size, short timeframe, not fully representative of all users

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- R (tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2, dplyr)
- RMarkdown for documentation and reporting
- Excel/Power BI (optional) for dashboarding

📈 Visualizations & Insights
- Daily Steps vs Calories Burned
- More steps generally increase calorie burn, but effect plateaus after ~10k steps.
- Sleep Duration vs Calories Burned
- Weak negative correlation: longer sleep slightly linked to lower calorie burn.
- Hourly Heatmap of Steps
- Activity peaks in mornings and evenings; weekdays show structured patterns, weekends more irregular.
- Weight Progress Over Time
- Weight fluctuates with peaks and troughs, suggesting inconsistent lifestyle habits.
- Resting Heart Rate Over Time
- Some users maintain elevated resting HR, possibly indicating stress or low recovery.

🔗 Business Relevance
1. Trends in Smart Device Usage
- Users track steps, calories, sleep, weight, and HR.
- Sedentary behavior dominates, with bursts of activity.
- Sleep and weight patterns are inconsistent.
2. Application to Bellabeat Customers
- Provide personalized nudges for activity and sleep balance.
- Highlight stress and recovery monitoring via resting HR.
- Support weight management with trend-based feedback.
3. Marketing Strategy Implications
- Position Bellabeat as a holistic wellness companion, not just a fitness tracker.
- Emphasize personalization: “Bellabeat learns your daily rhythms.”
- Use gamification: challenges for consistent sleep + activity balance.
- Promote stress reduction and recovery features as differentiators.

🚀 Recommendations
- Add features that reward balanced activity + sleep, not just step counts.
- Introduce sedentary alerts and stress recovery tips.
- Personalize insights: “On days you walk >10,000 steps, you sleep 30 minutes longer.”
- Market Bellabeat as a lifestyle coach for women’s wellness.

⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset is small and not representative of all demographics.
- Sleep and HR data may not be clinically validated.
- Short timeframe limits long-term trend analysis.

📄 Final Deliverables
- R scripts for cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Visualizations (ggplot2)
- Case study report with insights and recommendations
